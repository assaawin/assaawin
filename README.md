# Hello, World! 👋 I'm Issa

Educator | Computer Science Student | UX Designer | Front-End Developer

## About Me 🎯

I am an educator and lifelong learner currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the **University for Development Studies**. My journey is focused on merging the empathetic, user-centric principles of UX Design with the technical execution of Front-End Development, which I am actively sharpening through the intensive program at **alx Africa**.

My background in teaching fuels my passion for creating intuitive, accessible, and empowering digital products. I believe in technology that serves people, and I'm building the technical skills to make that belief a reality.
