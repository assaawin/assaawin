# Hello, World! 👋 I'm Issa

Educator | Computer Science Student | UX Designer | Front-End Developer

## About Me 🎯

My journey began in the classroom, fueled by a desire to empower others. Now, I'm channeling that same purpose into the digital world. As a Computer Science student at [**University for Development Studies (UDS)**](https://www.uds.edu.gh/) and a front-end developer in training at [**ALX Africa**](https://www.alxafrica.com/), I am learning to craft experiences that are not only technically sound but also deeply human—because the best technology feels like it was built just for you.
